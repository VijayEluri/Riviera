/**
 * Applies an input to an output.
 * <p>
 * All functions should rely solely on the input provided to determine the
 * appropriate output. Equal inputs should produce equal outputs. Output
 * instances must be unique unless the output is immutable. These conditions
 * imply that a function should be immutable.
 * <p>
 * Functions should strive to be pure, but they may modify the provided input
 * value if doing so is essential to the function's operation. For example, a
 * file read operation must modify the input to retrieve the next value. On the
 * other hand, a sort operation should return a new list.
 * <p>
 * Functions are only provided one argument, so functions that rely on more than
 * one argument should return a function. This is true even for two-argument
 * operations such as addition and multiplication. In other words, functions
 * must be curried. The returned function should take care to ensure it remains
 * immutable; it must copy the provided argument if the argument is not
 * immutable.
