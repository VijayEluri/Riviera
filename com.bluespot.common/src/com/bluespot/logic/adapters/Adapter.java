/**
 * Adapts a given value to another type. Many common adapters can be obtained
 * from the static factory methods in {@link Adapters}. Adapters are also widely
 * used by {@link Predicate} objects and their builders.
 * <p>
 * Adapters follow a small set of guidelines, similar in spirit to the
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Predicate} contracts:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Adapters are consistent.</em> Adapters convert a given value the same
 * way consistently. This implies that adapters are immutable.
 * <li><em>Adapters have no side-effects.</em> Adapters should convert values
 * without modifying the given value.
 * <li><em>Adapters throw exceptions in exceptional circumstances.</em>
 * Adapters, when given a value that is invalid or unexpected, should throw an
 * appropriate exception.
 * <li><em>Adapters gracefully handle null values</em>. Adapters should silently
 * return {@code null} unless they're explicitly expecting that value.
 * <li><em>Adapters should not guess.</em> Adapters do not attempt to guess the
 * intentions of a ill-formed value. If it is convertible in its current state,
 * it should be converted. If it cannot be converted, an exception should be
 * raised.
 * </ul>
